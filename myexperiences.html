        <p>Most of my best expiriences from my school were part of clubs. For example I had a blast during my first
            MUN as part of the Symposium club in SISMUN. It was extremely enjoyable and I am very glad to have gone.

        <p>I have also had a phenomenal time as part of the robotics club of our school and have 
            gone for multiple robotics competitions as part of our school.
